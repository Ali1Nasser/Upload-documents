## GraphNetwork — round 1 (2026-10-15, critic, fresh read; baselines p0/a1/p50/p100 at 960x540 lite scale 0.5, plus reports/p7/snap/GraphNetwork.jpg)

Verdict: APPROVED (score 7.4, no blocking issue). meta.json set to approved-critic.

Scores (06 section 3.3 + component acceptance): subject clarity 8, mechanism visible 7 (NameNode/DataNode metadata + block fetch reads; p100 payment chain reads), look parity 6.5, typography 8 (Arabic shaping and "ال NameNode" mixed-script order correct), camera and depth 6 (component only, no parallax/particles; camera comes from the rig), legibility 7, accuracy/no invented numbers 9 (no numerals on screen), continuity/tokens 9 (palette only via C.*), polish 7.5, no bullet-slide look 8, no legacy frames 10.

Verified: wedge layout puts children in the parent's direction; no wire crosses the centre; router keeps wires off foreign chips, hull label chips and the "metadata" edge-label chip in p50 and p100.

Non-blocking issues (fix before pilot use, in priority order):
1. p50, region x 380-520 / y 215-370 (NameNode to DataNode C/D wires) and p100, region x 400-560 / y 290-320 (gateway to wallet/notifications): inactive wires are 1 px hairlines at low contrast with arrowheads about 6 px at 960 width; raise inactive stroke to about 1.5 px and arrowhead x1.4 so they survive 1080p H.264.
2. p50, region x 275-370 / y 105-135 and x 365-455 / y 315-340: hull label chips show a visible darker rectangle over the hull border; use a gradient mask or match the hull fill.
3. p100: whole frame; flat against the 04 section 5 standard (no particle motes, no depth falloff between active and idle nodes beyond glow). Add a faint idle-node depth scale or soft shadow; parallax is expected from DepthLayers at scene level.
4. a1, region x 675-700 / y 100-115: a detached wire stub floats near the client chip during entrance; start wire draw after both endpoints have settled.
5. Motion intent (pulse travel, addEdge draw, highlightPath dimming) cannot be judged from stills; supply a 12 fps strip of frames 145-200 at round 2.
